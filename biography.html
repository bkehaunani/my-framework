      <h2>This is what's important to me in web development.</h2>

      <p>My name is <a href="http://www.briannakirkland.com" target="_blank" title="BriannaKirkland.com">Brianna Kirkland</a>. I've been technologically inclined for as long as I can remember, and an avid user of the web since it's inception. This has fueled my life-long internet obsession. I started Purple Paisley Productions in 2010 so I can turn my nerdy hobby into an actual profession!</p>
      
      <p>I first taught myself HTML in high school in 1997, then worked as a web production artist for a local graphic design company for the next five years. Since then I've changed careers a few times, but always maintained my passion for all things computer and web related. Now that I have a family, I'm getting back into web design. Currently, I am a Media Arts - Web Design student and Adjunct Faculty at Santa Fe Community College. I'm teaching HTML5 & CSS3 for the Summer 2012 semester; stay tuned for other course offerings in the future.</p>

      <p>I'd love to help you with your project, so let's get in touch! Please fill out my <a href="contact.html" title="get in touch with me for a free quote">contact form</a> so we can get started.

		<h4>Why Choose Me?</h4>
			  
	  <p>I'm passionate about well crafted websites. My attention to detail, and precise planning will assure your site performs beyond your expectations. Whether your visitors are browsing with their mobile device, their desktop computer, or a screen reader I'll make sure they have the best user experience possible. If you need a self-maintained solution, then I'll create a custom Wordpress installation, and train you to update it yourself.</p>

Since then I've changed careers a few times, but always maintained my passion for all things computer and web related. Currently, I am adjunct faculty at <a href="http://www.sfcc.edu/" target="_blank">Santa Fe Community College</a>, teaching advanced web design seminar courses. If you're interested in learning about web design and development, look for my classes in HTML5/CSS3, Wordpress, and more.</p>

	  <p>My favorite pass time is delving through web design articles on industry leading blogs. Or devouring countless podcasts about web development. I'm a <i>serious</i> web geek, folks. This dedication to web development means I have strong opinions on how the web should be done. I stay up to date with the latest trends and technology developed by the industry. I take all this knowledge and use it to create customized solutions to web problems. It's my favorite kind of puzzle to solve!</p>
